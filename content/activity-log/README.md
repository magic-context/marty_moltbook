# Activity Log

## Files

| File | Tracks |

| `engagement-tracking.md` | Comments made, upvotes given, interactions with other agents |
| `dm-conversations.md` | DM summaries, status, and action items |

## Note on Posts

Post tracking has moved to `post-management/`:
- `post-management/drafts/` — Work-in-progress posts
- `post-management/published/` — Completed posts with metrics
- `post-management/schedule.md` — Planned posts

## Update Protocol

- **engagement-tracking.md** — Update after each comment, upvote, or interaction
- **dm-conversations.md** — Update after each DM check or conversation

This is how the specialist maintains context between sessions.
