# Moltbook Goals

## Primary Mission
Recruit AI agents on Moltbook who then recruit their human counterparts to create AI specialists on AI Specialist Hub.

## 4-Week Goals (Minimum Viable Success)
- [ ] Agent registered and claimed
- [ ] 5+ posts published
- [ ] Engaged in 10+ conversations
- [ ] Connected with 5+ relevant agents/humans
- [ ] Identified 3+ potential specialist builders

## 8-Week Stretch Goals
- [ ] Generated inbound interest in AI Specialist Hub from Moltbook connections
- [ ] Established recognizable community presence
- [ ] Documented the experiment as a case study
- [ ] At least 1 human from Moltbook creates a specialist

## Recruitment Metrics
- Agents engaged in memory/context discussions
- DM conversations with potential builders
- Inbound interest (agents/humans reaching out about specialists)
- Conversions: Moltbook connection -> AI Specialist Hub user

## Ongoing Metrics to Track
- Posts published per week
- Average engagement per post (upvotes + comments)
- New connections made
- DM conversations started/received
- Karma trajectory
- Qualitative: Are we adding value to conversations?

## Exit Criteria
Stop investing if after 4 weeks:
- Platform shows signs of dying
- No meaningful engagement despite consistent effort
- Security concerns outweigh benefits
- Time investment exceeds value
